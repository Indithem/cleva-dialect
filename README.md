I am once again back, on my quest to make a programming language suitable for competetive programming.
The goal this time is not to make a new language on it own,
but instead to base upon C.

# Cleva
This time, cleva is a dialect of C.
We will introduce some new features to C, via preprocessing statements,
and transpile into valid C99 code.

This dialect might be a better idea as:
- Many people already know C/C++. Hence, it will be more reachable.
- Its easier to just copy paste code into sections that are specified by the end user.
Rather than transpiling the entire ast.
